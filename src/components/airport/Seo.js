                        Whenever someone thinks of Orlando,
                        they immediately think of Disney World.

                        attractions are fed by MCO airport.
                        MCO is the Orlando areaâ€™s international
                        airport; a sort of revolving door for

                        MCO scores points for being clean and efficient
                        it's a large airport. It is spacious,
                        and has a lot of natural lighting,
                        as found in the atrium area.

                        the Hyatt Regency, located right
                        inside the airport for convenient

                        Security checkpoints can slow considerably
                        due to the high volume of tourist traffic.
                        Likewise, lines for restaurants and stores
                        can also get anxiously long during peak hours.
                        Baggage return also suffers from slow service,
                        further adding to frustrating wait times.
